# Coffeediary

Welcome to Coffeediary!

This app is my very own, personal solution to a small but important problem: keeping track of the best espresso recipes for all the specialty coffees I love to try. Sure, I could have used a regular notebook—but as a software developer, what else do you do on a Saturday afternoon but build an app? And having an amazing espresso.

But damn, what was the correct grindsize for the brazilian 60/40 from my local bean-dealer?!

## What does Coffeediary do?

Coffeediary is my digital coffee journal. It helps me record, organize, and revisit every espresso recipe and extraction. Whenever I switch beans or experiment with a new recipe, I can log all the details—grind size, ratio, amount, extraction time—so I never lose track of what works best for each coffee.

## Why Coffeediary?

With so many amazing coffees out there, it’s easy to forget the perfect recipe for each one. Coffeediary is my way of making sure I always have my personal coffee journey at hand, ready to recreate the best cup every time.

If you’re a coffee lover and a bit of a nerd like me, I hope Coffeediary helps you enjoy your brews and experiments just as much as I do!

If you want to try it out, shoot me an email, I might add you to the users. 
Currently this app is quite heavily bound to supabase and its api, as I put focus on functionality and to have the app up for the next coffee!



Enjoy your coffee adventures!
